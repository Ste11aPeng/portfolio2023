                        <p>During the summer of 2023, I participated in the SI 350: UX Field Research for
                            Public Sector course at the University of Michigan School of Information. This course
                            focused on applying UX research methodologies to solve challenges within public sector
                            environments. As part of a hands-on, team-based project,I focused on exploring <span
                                class="colorful-text">the
                                communication needs of
                                young adults in Ann Arbor regarding Vision Zero initiatives, which aim to eliminate
                                traffic
                                fatalities and improve transportation safety.</span>
                            <br> <br>
                            Our research centered on <span class="colorful-text">understanding the thoughts, feelings,
                                and awareness of young adults
                                who work, live, and play (WLP)</span> in the city. By conducting user interviews and
                            analyzing
                            behaviors, we identified key opportunities to enhance communication between the city and
                            this demographic to foster safer and more comfortable transportation experiences.

                    <h2 class="project-subtitle">Survey</h2>
                    <p class="scroll-trigger">Firstly, our team distributed a survey to 295 Ann Arbor residents. Of this
                        pool, 82% of
                        respondents were in our target demo of young adults, aged 19-29. Distributed through social
                        media forums, flyers with QR codes, and our personal networks, the survey captured the attitudes
                        and experiences of young adults on various trips driving, walking, cycling, or using the transit
                        system in Ann Arbor. <br> <br>We also asked respondents about their awareness of and feelings
                        toward
                        Vision Zero. The survey was only open for 10 days, limiting the window for us to obtain
                        responses. Additionally, it should be noted that responses discussed travel in the Springtime,
                        and is likely not generalizable to the times when we are trudging through snow for 7 months out
                        of the year. <br> <br>Finally, it is important to consider that the current student population
                        is
                        quite
                        low in comparison to the school year, and that survey distribution occurred primarily in
                        downtown AA, and may not fully represent all residents. This limited time frame, time of year,
                        and respondent sourcing is worth considering across our other research methods as well.</p>
                    <img src="images/350_Methodology1.png" alt="hahha">
                    <h2 class="project-subtitle">Interview</h2>
                    <p>After initially distributing the surveys, we immediately began conducting interviews. <br>First,
                        we
                        facilitated street interviews with pedestrians, while scheduling more formal interviews with
                        survey respondents who indicated an interest. These interviews more directly inquired about the
                        knowledge, perceptions, and behaviors of residents regarding traffic safety as pedestrians or
                        cyclists. Interview data was analyzed and coded into affinity diagrams and empathy maps to see
                        if and how individual responses demonstrated patterns of how users think and feel about traffic
                        safety measures.</p>
                    <img src="images/350_Methodology2.png" alt="hahha">
                    <h2 class="project-subtitle">Observations & Travel Diary</h2>
                    <p>To better situate ourselves in the context of traffic safety, we also observed residents
                        interacting with new traffic safety infrastructure, as seen in the map on the right. This better
                        framed our ambitions to view the problem statement through an experience/interaction design
                        problem. <br> <br>
                        Finally, throughout the past 4 weeks, our team has been recording travel diaries on our travels
                        throughout the city.
                        Along our routes, we noted the routes and method of our trip, as well as any notable safety
                        features or concerns that caught our eyes along the way.</p>
